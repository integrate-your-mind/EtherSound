# Ethersound
A democratized, decentralized place to listen and share music.

## Our Mission
The goal of Ethersound is to provide a high-throughput content distribution network with the ability to publish public and private media easily. You can think of it like a decentralized 'simulation' of SoundCloud. The goal is to encourage users to grow through learning. You will be able to learn about audio formats, compression, blockchain, and more, all without paying for a subscription to SoundCloud.
